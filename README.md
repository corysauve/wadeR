# wader

wader includes calculations common in limnology and stream ecology. This
package mostly serves as a place where I put calculations I either use a
lot or ones I don’t want to forget where I saved them to. Because of
that, this package changes frequently and should be viewed as under
development. Perhaps in the future I’ll make a stable release

[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
